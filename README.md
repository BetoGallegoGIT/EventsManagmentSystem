# Event Management System 📅

A Java Swing application for planning and managing events, ranging from large conferences to small meetings. This project was developed as the final assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course.

## 🚀 Features

* **Event Management:** Create, modify, and delete events with details like date, location, and description.
* **Attendee Registration:** Manage guest lists for each specific event (Name, Email, DNI, Phone).
* **Data Persistence:** Uses text files (`events.txt`, `attendees.txt`) to save data between sessions.
* **Smart Filtering:** View and sort events by "All", "Future", or "Past" dates.
* **Validation:** Robust data validation for numeric inputs (DNI/Phone) to prevent errors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **GUI:** Java Swing (JFrame, JDialog, JList)
* **Concept:** Object-Oriented Design (Singleton Pattern, MVC principles)
* **Storage:** File I/O (CSV format)

## 📦 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.
3.  Run the `App` class.
4.  *Note:* The necessary data files will be created automatically upon saving your first event.

## 🚀 Roadmap & Upcoming Features

This project is actively evolving. The following features are planned for the next version to fully cover the advanced requirements:

* **Resource Management:** Implementation of a system to manage and allocate resources such as venues (rooms), AV equipment, and catering services to specific events.
* **Visual Calendar:** Integration of a graphical calendar view to visualize and organize events more intuitively.
* **Smart Notifications:** Automated email or in-app reminders to notify attendees about upcoming events they are registered for.
* **Participation Analytics:** A new module to generate reports on attendance rates and collect user feedback after events.
